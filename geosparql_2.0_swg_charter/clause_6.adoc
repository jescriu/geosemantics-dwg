== Anticipated Audience / Participants

The anticipated audience is:

* implementors of Semantic Web systems that support, or plan to support spatial data
* integrators of spatial data on the web
* developers and data modellers using graph database systems for spatial data

We hope that this enhanced version of GeoSPARQL will be widely applicable as a spatial concepts and data representation model. It is expected to be of great interest to those implementing specialised or partly spatial Internet systems that need to share information with others due to its native web-based and inherently extensible form (as per all Semantic Web applications).
