[big]*i.     Abstract*

This white paper describes the benefits of representing geospatial data using semantic, graph and web technologies. To achieve this, it provides a number of use cases, benefits, and beneficiaries for representing data using semantic, graph and web technoligies. It goes on to provide an overview of the current capabilties of the GeoSPARQL standard and some of its shortcomings that, if addressed, would unlock its potential to a greater extent. It also identifies other related activities that are current at the time of editing this paper.

In doing so, the paper establishes both the value proposition for updating the GeoSPARQL standard, and the need for liaison between related activities to achieve alignment.
