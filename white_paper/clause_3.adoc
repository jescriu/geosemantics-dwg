=== GeoSPARQL

GeoSPARQL is the most common geospatial extension of SPARQL. It was accepted as an OGC standard in 2012.

According to the standard document, "The OGC GeoSPARQL standard supports representing and querying geospatial data on the Semantic Web. GeoSPARQL defines a vocabulary for representing geospatial data in RDF, and it defines an extension to the SPARQL query language for processing geospatial data".

==== Requirements addressed

GeoSPARQL addresses the following requirements.

===== Requirement 1: Integrate with SPARQL

Implementations shall allow the RDFS class geo:SpatialObject to be used in SPARQL graph patterns.

===== Requirement 3: Represent Features in SPARQL

Implementations shall allow the RDFS class geo:Feature to be used in SPARQL graph patterns.

===== Requirement 4: Represent Simple Features Spatial Relationships in SPARQL

Implementations shall allow the properties geo:sfEquals, geo:sfDisjoint, geo:sfIntersects, geo:sfTouches, geo:sfCrosses, geo:sfWithin, geo:sfContains, geo:sfOverlaps to be used in SPARQL graph patterns

==== Adoption

Semantic and graph technologies need software to store and retrieve data. As this type of data can be about any subject, such a product would do well to support spatial data. Most, if not all products support the most basic spatial data type: a point with geographic coordinates. Some products offer idiosyncratic means to work with more complex spatial data. But a significant number of products used for semantic and graph data have opted to support GeoSPARQL, offering a large amount of standardized spatial data types, and the functions that come along.
To our knowledge, the following products support GeoSPARQL (in alphabetical order).
