== Domain Working Group Endorsement

This SWG scope addresses requirements for interoperable best practices in both geosemantics and metadata catalogs, and hence will report to both the Geosemantics and MetCat Domain Working Groups.

The Chairs of the Geosemantics DWG, Joseph Abhayaratna and Linda van den Brink, and the chairs of the MetaCat DWG, Danny Vandenbrouk and Byron Cochrane do formally endorse the formation of the GeoDCAT Standards Working Group (SWG).
